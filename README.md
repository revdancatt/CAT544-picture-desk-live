CAT544 Picture Desk Live
========================

A Google AppEngine backend that will go and fetch the
latest Guardian Picture Desk Live liveblog, storing
the info and providing an API endpoint for the front
end to display the images.

The first task is to make the user enter a Guardian
developer API key.

The to backfill all the old PDL liveblogs.

Then to poll the API for new content.
